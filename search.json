By examining cancer mortality based on sex, age, and race, we can gain insights into how different demographic groups may be affected by cancer and the possible risk factors. This can help identify populations that are particularly vulnerable or may require targeted interventions. To understand the risk factors, we may help those people who we care about to avoid cancer."

However, the metadata names are not canonical and not organized well, and there are absences of metadata. For example, the data in the columns on Breast Cancer didn’t collect the data by sex, compared to colorectal and lung cancer. What is more, for the three types of cancer that the dataset recorded, the data for ages below 18 are not collected.\nThis may be because cancer mortality is relatively low in people under the age of 18 and might be hard to access the exact value, and data collectors believe that this particular breakdown of cancer mortality does not have much impact on the analysis of the overall data.\n\n\nData Cleaning\nuse isnull() to detect missing values for an array-like object.\n\n# examining missing values\nprint(\"Missing values distribution: \")\nprint(df_cancer.isnull().mean())\n\nMissing values distribution: \nState                                 0.0\nTotal.Rate                            0.0\nTotal.Number                          0.0\nTotal.Population                      0.0\nRates.Age.&lt; 18                        0.0\n                                     ... \nTypes.Lung.Race.Black                 0.0\nTypes.Lung.Race.Black non-Hispanic    0.0\nTypes.Lung.Race.Asian                 0.0\nTypes.Lung.Race.Indigenous            0.0\nTypes.Lung.Race.Hispanic              0.0\nLength: 75, dtype: float64\n\n\nNo missing values found.\n\n\n\n2.

Median AQI Datasets\nRead the data frame, and perform data pre-processing and data cleaning.\nSince the data we need would be the column of median AQI merely, we will first use dict to store the average annual data for each state in each year, null values are skipped, in order to avoid them affecting the calculation result. After iteration over, the dict will consist of state name as the key and lists of annual median AQI as the value. Further, calculate the average value for each list to get an average median AQI in the time interval and take the result to update the previous value (which is a list) of the dict.\nFinally, we get a dict that consists of the state name as the key and the average median AQI value as the value. In the next section, this dict would be merged into the cancer dataset.\nThere are 7 datasets we need to iterate, use pathlib library to search for files that match a specific file pattern or name.

    "text": "Initial Exploration\n\nUnderstand The Data\nWe will first have a data summary for the cancer dataset, which is directly relevant to the topic of the project.\nFor understanding the data, using the 5W2H method could help us to arrive at the following analytical ideas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5W2H\nAnalytical Ideas\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\nAnalyze the total cancer mortality for each state and the death rate for specific types of cancer. We can also compare differences in cancer mortality by gender, age, and race.\n\n\nWhy?\nAnalyzing cancer mortality can help us understand the impact of different factors on cancer risk and death. By identifying high-risk groups and possible risk factors, we can take preventive measures and provide targeted medical care.\n\n\nWhere?\nCompare cancer death rates between different states to see if there are geographic differences. We can also determine which states have higher or lower cancer death rates.\n\n\nWhen?\nThe time range of the data set is 2007 to 2013, however, the dataset shows average value in this time interval merely. Thus, we should also care about the time interval while seeking the associated datasets.\n\n\nWho?\nAnalyze the differences in cancer mortality among people of different genders, ages, and ethnicities. This can help to understand whether specific populations are at higher risk.\n\n\nHow?\nUse statistical analysis methods to compare cancer mortality rates between different groups and look for correlations and trends. Alternatively, use data visualization to help better present and interpret data.\n\n\nHow much?\nLook at the extent to which different factors contribute to cancer mortality. By calculating differences and relative risks, we can assess the extent to which different factors contribute to cancer mortality.\n\n\n\nA map visualization would be helpful to identify the state and locate the problem at a geographical level. Initially, we will use the map to have a basic geographical overview and to identify the state sample we need for the project.\n\n# reference for this:https://gist.github.com/rogerallen/1583593 (A Python Dictionary to translate US States to Two letter codes)\nus_state_to_abbrev = {\n    \"Alabama\": \"AL\",\n    \"Alaska\": \"AK\",\n    \"Arizona\": \"AZ\",\n    \"Arkansas\": \"AR\",\n    \"California\": \"CA\",\n    \"Colorado\": \"CO\",\n    \"Connecticut\": \"CT\",\n    \"Delaware\": \"DE\",\n    \"Florida\": \"FL\",\n    \"Georgia\": \"GA\",\n    \"Hawaii\": \"HI\",\n    \"Idaho\": \"ID\",\n    \"Illinois\": \"IL\",\n    \"Indiana\": \"IN\",\n    \"Iowa\": \"IA\",\n    \"Kansas\": \"KS\",\n    \"Kentucky\": \"KY\",\n    \"Louisiana\": \"LA\",\n    \"Maine\": \"ME\",\n    \"Maryland\": \"MD\",\n    \"Massachusetts\": \"MA\",\n    \"Michigan\": \"MI\",\n    \"Minnesota\": \"MN\",\n    \"Mississippi\": \"MS\",\n    \"Missouri\": \"MO\",\n    \"Montana\": \"MT\",\n    \"Nebraska\": \"NE\",\n    \"Nevada\": \"NV\",\n    \"New Hampshire\": \"NH\",\n    \"New Jersey\": \"NJ\",\n    \"New Mexico\": \"NM\",\n    \"New York\": \"NY\",\n    \"North Carolina\": \"NC\",\n    \"North Dakota\": \"ND\",\n    \"Ohio\": \"OH\",\n    \"Oklahoma\": \"OK\",\n    \"Oregon\": \"OR\",\n    \"Pennsylvania\": \"PA\",\n    \"Rhode Island\": \"RI\",\n    \"South Carolina\": \"SC\",\n    \"South Dakota\": \"SD\",\n    \"Tennessee\": \"TN\",\n    \"Texas\": \"TX\",\n    \"Utah\": \"UT\",\n    \"Vermont\": \"VT\",\n    \"Virginia\": \"VA\",\n    \"Washington\": \"WA\",\n    \"West Virginia\": \"WV\",\n    \"Wisconsin\": \"WI\",\n    \"Wyoming\": \"WY\",\n    \"District of Columbia\": \"DC\",\n    \"American Samoa\": \"AS\",\n    \"Guam\": \"GU\",\n    \"Northern Mariana Islands\": \"MP\",\n    \"Puerto Rico\": \"PR\",\n    \"United States Minor Outlying Islands\": \"UM\",\n    \"U.S. Virgin Islands\": \"VI\",\n}\ndf_cancer['Abbreviation'] = df_cancer['State'].map(us_state_to_abbrev)\n# Create the choropleth map\nfig = px.choropleth(df_cancer,\n                    locations=df_cancer['Abbreviation'],\n                    locationmode='USA-states',  # set the location mode to 'country names' for USA states\n                    color='Total.Rate',  # the variable to be represented by color\n                    hover_name='State',  # the values to be displayed when hovering over each state\n                    scope='usa',  # set the scope to 'usa' for United States map\n                    title='Cancer Mortality by State 2007-2013')\n\n# Show the map\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nClick the color block could see the numerical data for the region.\nGeographically, the map helps identify regions with higher or lower cancer mortality levels, revealing patterns and contrasts. There are geographical differences in lung cancer mortality. Cancer death rate is higher in the eastern states than in the western states overall.\nAnd obviously, West Virginia is the state which has the highest cancer mortality, and on the other hand, Utah has the lowest cancer mortality.\n\n\nQ1: Which types of cancer have the highest death rates overall?\nWe are going to use a pie chart to analyze the proportion of different types of cancer mortality in this dataset to investigate which types of cancer have the highest death rates overall. The value on each slice represents the average rates of each cancer type for all states.\n\nbreast_total = df_cancer['Types.Breast.Total'].mean()\ncolorectal_total = df_cancer['Types.Colorectal.Total'].mean()\nlung_total = df_cancer['Types.Lung.Total'].mean()\ncancer_counts = [breast_total, colorectal_total, lung_total]\ncancer_labels = ['Breast Cancer', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Lung Cancer']\n# create the pie chart\nplt.pie(cancer_counts, labels=cancer_labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('The Proportion of Different Types of Cancer in United States')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe could see from the above figures that, lung cancer is the main cancer type that leads to death among these three types of cancer in the United States. It answered the first research question, would discuss further in the next section.\nThe map visualization above already indicates the approximate ranking of cancer mortality to some extend, would it be the same for lung cancer?\nUse a bar plot to visualize the comparison to see the ranking:\n\nstates = df_cancer[\"State\"]\ntotal_rates = df_cancer[\"Types.Lung.Total\"]\n\n# Sort the states and total_rates in descending order\nsorted_indices = np.argsort(total_rates)\nsorted_states = states[sorted_indices]\nsorted_total_rates = total_rates[sorted_indices]\n\n# Plot the bar chart\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))\n\n# Find the index of the highest bar\nhighest_index = np.argmax(sorted_total_rates)\n\n# Set colors for bars\ncolors = ['#421168'] * len(sorted_states)\ncolors[highest_index] = '#fca50a'\n\nax.barh(sorted_states, sorted_total_rates, color=colors)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Lung Cancer Mortality 2007-2013\", weight='bold', size=10)\nax.set_ylabel(\"State\", labelpad=20, weight='bold', size=10)\nax.set_title(\"Lung Cancer Mortality Comparison by State\", weight='bold', size=12)\nvals = ax.get_xticks()\n\nfor tick in vals:\n  ax.axvline(x=tick, linestyle='dashed', alpha=0.4, color='#eeeeee', zorder=1) \nplt.axvline(x=np.nanmean(total_rates), color='red', ls='dotted')\nax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe dotted line means the average cancer rate for states. As the above figure shows, Utah is the state which has the lowest lung cancer death rate. And West Virginia is the state with the highest lung cancer death rate. This result is the same as what the map visualization has shown.\nIn order to reduce the error by reducing the diversity of the data and to take into account that the risk factors of different cancers may be different, the subsequent analysis will focus on lung cancer only. And For the analysis part, we are going to choose West Virginia as a basic sample for this study to investigate why its lung cancer rate was the highest.\nWould the cancer rate be different for different ages? I believe no one would say no. But a data visualization can help us to confirm this. Next, we are going to display a line plot to analyze trends in lung cancer rates across age groups in the United States. It takes the average rate for states as the y-axis.\n\nage_groups = ['&lt; 18', '18 - 44', '45 - 64', '&gt; 64']\n\nlung_rates_female = [\n  0,\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Female.18 - 44'].mean(),\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Female.45 - 64'].mean(),\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Female.&gt; 64'].mean()\n]\nlung_rates_male = [\n  0,\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Male.18 - 44'].mean(),\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Male.45 - 64'].mean(),\n  df_cancer['Types.Lung.Age and Sex.Male.&gt; 64'].mean()\n]\nplt.plot(age_groups, lung_rates_female, marker='o', label='Female')\nplt.plot(age_groups, lung_rates_male, marker='o', label='Male')\n\nplt.xlabel('Age Group')\nplt.ylabel('Average Lung Cancer Rates')\nplt.title('Trend of Lung Cancer Rates Across Age Groups in the United States')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above figure, we could see the line rapidly increased in the elderly group (&gt; 64) for both females and males. It indicates that age supports the concept that lung cancer is a disease largely associated with aging; so the longer one lives, the greater that person’s risk for developing the disease.\nWe also can observe that the dataset does not have data for the age group under 18, the potential reason might be that the access to collect this data was difficult during 2007-2013 and the rate is extremely small. To make the plots “good” and more comprehensive, 0 is assigned to this age group in this plot. We will discuss more details about this data absence in the section of Discussion.\nAnd from the plot, we also notice that the trend for males is more rapid than for females, why?"

Its ranking among the states is the same as its ranking of cancer death rate. Therefore, the correlation between education attainment and cancer death rate could be identified from the combined ranking. However, we still need to identify if this factor also applies to other states.\nTo further explore if this factor also affects other states, we need scatter plots to make a regression analysis. The plots consist of two sub-plots. They take the lung cancer death rate as the dependent variable (y-axis), and take the highly-educated level and non-highly-educated level rate as the independent variables (x-axis), the dots mean each state in the U.S.\n\ncancer_rate = 'Types.Lung.Total'\n# Merge the dataframes\ndf_merged = pd.merge(df_edu, df_cancer, on='State')\n\n# calculate higher-educated rate and high school diploma or less rate\ndf_merged['Proportion of Higher-Educated'] = df_merged['Completing college'] + df_merged['Completing some college']\ndf_merged['Proportion of High School Diploma Only or Less'] = df_merged['Completing high school only'] + df_merged['Not completing high school']\n\n# Create scatter plots with regression line\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 10))\n\n# Iterate over the sub-plots\nfor ax, column in zip(axes, ['Proportion of Higher-Educated', 'Proportion of High School Diploma Only or Less']):\n  sns.regplot(x=column, y=cancer_rate, data=df_merged, ax=ax, scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5}, line_kws={'color':'red'})\n  ax.set_xlabel(column, weight='bold', size=10)\n  ax.set_ylabel('Cancer Mortality')\n    \n  # calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\n  correlation = df_merged[column].corr(df_merged[cancer_rate])\n    \n  # Highlight and label data point for West Virginia\n  west_virginia = df_merged[df_merged['State'] == 'West Virginia']\n  ax.scatter(west_virginia[column], west_virginia[cancer_rate], color='red', label='West Virginia')\n    \n  # add Pearson correlation coefficient as text label\n  ax.text(0.6, 0.1, f'Pearson Coef (r): {correlation:.2f}', transform=ax.transAxes, fontsize=10, ha='right', va='bottom')\n  ax.legend()\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.suptitle(\"Regression Analysis of Educational Attainment Ratio & Cancer Mortality\", weight='bold', size=12)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\ndataframe.corr() outputs the pairwise Pearson correlation (a value of ± 1) of these two variables.\nAlthough interpretations of the relationship strength (also known as effect size) vary between disciplines, the table below gives general rules of thumb (Ref Link).\n\n\n\nPearson correlation coefficient (r) value\nStrength\nDirection\n\n\n\n\nGreater than .5\nStrong\nPositive\n\n\nBetween .3 and .5\nModerate\nPositive\n\n\nBetween 0 and .3\nWeak\nPositive\n\n\n0\nNone\nNone\n\n\nBetween 0 and –.3\nWeak\nNegative\n\n\nBetween –.3 and –.5\nModerate\nNegative\n\n\nLess than –.5\nStrong\nNegative\n\n\n\nAs the Pearson coefficient of correlation r (0.76) we got from the plot and table shown above, we can conclude that there is a strong negative correlation between the perception of higher-educated people and cancer mortality.

    "text": "Assume 2: Environment - Air Quality Index\nWe are going to analyze the correlation between environment and cancer mortality.\nWe will analyze it through calculate the correlation coefficient between the median Air Quality Index (AQI) for states from 2007-2013.\nExplaination for AQI: &gt; Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air &gt;pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, &gt;while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality. &gt; &gt;For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the level of &gt;the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are &gt;generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain &gt;sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.\n\nRegression Analysis\nThe dataset df_aqi has been pre-processed in the last section. Merge the data to df_cancer:\n\n # Merge the dataframes\nmerged_df = pd.DataFrame({'State': list(state_aqi_avg_dict.keys()),\n                          'Avg Median AQI': list(state_aqi_avg_dict.values())})\nmerged_df = merged_df.merge(df_cancer, on='State')\n\ncancer_rate = 'Types.Lung.Total'\npearson_coef = merged_df['Avg Median AQI'].corr(merged_df[f\"{cancer_rate}\"])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.regplot(x='Avg Median AQI', y=f\"{cancer_rate}\", data=merged_df, line_kws={'color':'red'}, scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5}, label='State')\n\ntext = f\"Pearson Coef(r): {pearson_coef:.2f}\"\nplt.text(merged_df['Avg Median AQI'].max(), merged_df[f\"{cancer_rate}\"].min(), text, verticalalignment=\"top\", horizontalalignment=\"right\")\nplt.xlabel('Average Median AQI')\nplt.ylabel('Lung Cancer Mortality')\nplt.title('Regression Analysis of Average Median AQI vs. Lung Cancer Mortality')\n\n# Highlight the data point for West Virginia\nwest_virginia = merged_df.loc[merged_df['State'] == 'West Virginia']\nsns.scatterplot(data=west_virginia, x='Avg Median AQI', y=f\"{cancer_rate}\", color='red')\n\n# Highlight the state labels for specified states\nhighlight_states = ['West Virginia', 'Utah', 'Alaska', 'California']\nfor i, state in enumerate(merged_df['State']):\n  if state in highlight_states:\n    plt.annotate(state, (merged_df['Avg Median AQI'][i], merged_df[f\"{cancer_rate}\"][i]), textcoords='offset points', xytext=(3,5))\n        \nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above figure, we can see that these two variables have a positive association because as median AQI by state increases, so does the cancer death rate by state. However, the relationship that the plot has shown is weak.\nThere are many states that have poorer air quality than west virginia, such as California and Utah, but their cancer death rate is much lower than West Virginia.\nThrough the value of r we have (0.19) and the table above, unexpectedly, the cancer death rate by the state was positively correlated to the median AQI (air quality) index weakly. There might be some possible reasons for this: - Overall, the values of median AQI for all states are below 50, which is considered satisfactory and healthy air quality through EPA’s explanation. Therefore, it would be difficult to monitor whether air quality affects cancer mortality.\n\nSome other potential influences: For example, smoking rates, eating habits, genetics, population distribution by age or race, etc.\n\nTherefore, the influence of air quality would be difficult to detect in the United States. To further investigate it, should expand the dataset to the foreign region which has unhealthy air quality."

And the lung cancer death rate would be still taken as the y-axis.\n\n# Merge the dataframes\ncancer_rate = 'Types.Lung.Total'\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df_age, df_cancer, on='State')\n\n# create the scatter plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.regplot(data=merged_df, x='Avg_Rate', y=f\"{cancer_rate}\", line_kws={'color':'red'}, scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5}, label='State')\nplt.xlabel('Average Age Population Distribution Rate')\nplt.ylabel('Lung Cancer Mortality')\nplt.title('Regression Analysis of Avg Population Proportion of Elderly (age &gt;= 65) and Lung Cancer Mortality')\n\n# Highlight the data point for West Virginia\nwest_virginia = merged_df.loc[merged_df['State'] == 'West Virginia']\nsns.scatterplot(data=west_virginia, x='Avg_Rate', y=f\"{cancer_rate}\", color='red')\n\n# calculate Pearson coefficient\npearson_coef = merged_df['Avg_Rate'].corr(merged_df['Total.Rate'])\ntext = f\"Pearson Coef(r): {pearson_coef:.2f}\"\nplt.text(merged_df['Avg_Rate'].max(), merged_df[f\"{cancer_rate}\"].min(), text, verticalalignment=\"top\", horizontalalignment=\"right\")\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient we obtained from the plot is 0.80 &gt; 0.50, which indicates that these two variables are strongly positively correlated. Therefore, we can conclude that as the population ages, the lung cancer death rate in a state would also increase."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, several measures can be taken to reduce cancer death rates and address the emerging challenges. Firstly, promoting education and literacy can empower individuals to make informed choices and navigate the healthcare system effectively, leading to better prevention and early detection of cancer. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle, encompassing regular exercise, a balanced diet, and the avoidance of high-risk behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, can significantly lower the incidence of cancer. Secondly, achieving equal access to healthcare services is crucial in ensuring that everyone has the opportunity for early detection and timely treatment. By reducing barriers to healthcare, including financial constraints and limited availability of services, we can improve outcomes and reduce cancer mortality rates. Furthermore, considering the impact of socioeconomic factors, such as educational attainment and race, is essential in identifying high-risk groups. Tailored support and interventions should be developed to address the specific needs and challenges faced by these vulnerable populations. By implementing targeted interventions and supporting these individuals, we can make significant strides in reducing cancer disparities and improving overall outcomes.\nOverall, the study underscores the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities to effectively reduce cancer mortality rates. By prioritizing preventive measures, early detection, and targeted support for high-risk groups, society can make substantial progress in combating the burden of cancer and improving overall public health."

    "text": "Limitations:\n\nThe baseline dataset is a rather limited dataset. It does not showcase the annual data for each year. Without the measurable time variable, we are not able to analyze the trend of the metadata change over time to have a deeper observation of the dataset.\nFor the same reason, the project has to search for associated datasets that were collected in the same time interval. However, while investigating, some associated datasets found do not collect the data for 2007. The reason is probably that the early Internet technology was not developed, and it was difficult to disseminate information and collect data. This phenomenon illustrates how the digital world is changing traditional research nowadays.\nA fact was found that while online inquiry, smoke is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer. And there should be a connection between smoke and the risk factors that this study has analyzed. The dataset of the smoke rate might help to have a deeper insight into the relationship among these risk factors."
