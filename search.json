    "text": "Motivations:\n\nUnderstanding demographic patterns: By examining cancer death rates based on sex, age, and race, researchers can gain insights into how different demographic groups may be affected by cancer. This can help identify populations that are particularly vulnerable or may require targeted interventions.\nPredictive modeling: By using the dataset to build predictive models, researchers can forecast future cancer death rates based on factors such as population growth, aging demographics, and changes in risk behaviors. This information can help policymakers allocate resources and plan cancer prevention initiatives."
